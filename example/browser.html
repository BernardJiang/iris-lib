    <h1>Saving the world with identifi-lib</h1>

    <p>The building blocks of Identifi data are digitally signed <b>Messages</b>
    which are typically <i>verifications</i> or <i>ratings</i>.</p>

    <p>Ratings are used to build a <i>web of trust</i>. Your web of trust consists
    of the identities that you have rated positively, the identities that they have rated
    positively and so on, up to an arbitrary <i>trust distance</i>.</p>

    <p>Verifications are claims that certain <b>Attributes</b>
    (name, email, bitcoin address etc.) belong to the same <b>Identity</b>.
    Verifications from your web of trust are used to bundle together
    attributes into Identity objects.</p>

    <p>Identifi-lib can be used to read and write <b>Indexes</b> of Messages and
    Identities. An Identifi <i>index root</i> typically contains four indexes:
    <i>messagesByTimestamp</i>, <i>messagesByTrustDistance</i>,
    <i>identitiesByTrustDistance</i> and <i>identitiesBySearchKey</i>.</p>

    <p>Index root example:
    <a href="https://identi.fi/ipns/Qmbb1DRwd75rZk5TotTXJYzDSJL6BaNT1DAQ6VbKcKLhbs">
      https://identi.fi/ipns/Qmbb1DRwd75rZk5TotTXJYzDSJL6BaNT1DAQ6VbKcKLhbs
    </a></p>

    <p>Identifi messages and indexes are stored on the distributed, censorship-resistant
    IPFS network</p>

    <h2>Including the library</h2>
    <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/identifi-lib/dist/identifiLib.min.js">&lt;/script></pre>
    <p>The lib will be available as <i>window.identifiLib</i>.</p>

    <h2>index = await Index.load(indexRootIpfsUri)</h2>
    <p>Load an Index from a given index root IPFS/IPNS URI. If ipfsUri is undefined,
    identi.fi index is loaded by default. As of April 2018, identi.fi index consists
    mostly of data crawled from bitcoin-otc.com.</p>

    <h2>index.search(query, limit)</h2>
    <p>Search an identifi index for identitiesBySearchKey. A list of matching
    Identity objects is returned.</p>
    <input type="text" value="ma" id="query" onkeyup="search()" class="form-control">
    <p id="searchResults"></p>

    <p>You can create a similar search widget with:</p>
    <pre>window.identifiLib.Identity.appendSearchWidget(parentElement, index);</pre>
    <p id="searchWidget"></p>

    <h2>index.get(value [, type])</h2>
    <p>Search the identitiesBySearchKey index using value and type. If an exact
    match is found, the resulting Identity object is returned. If type is not defined,
    it will be guessed using a regex list.</p>
    <p><input type="text" value="martti@moni.com" id="profileQuery" onkeyup="getProfile()" class="form-control"></p>
    <textarea style="width:100%" rows=10 id="profileResults" class="form-control"></textarea>

    <h3>identity.identicon(100)</h3>
    <p>Generate identicon of width 100px:</p>
    <p id="identicon"></p>

    <h3>identity.verified('name')</h3>
    <p>Get the most verified attribute of type 'name':</p>
    <p>Result: <b id="verifiedAttribute"></b></p>

    <h2>Create, sign and publish a message</h2>
    <pre>msg = Message.createRating(</pre>
    <textarea id="ratingMsg" style="width: 100%" rows=12 class="form-control">
      {
        "author": [
          ["name", "Alice"],
          ["keyID", "1234ABCD"]
        ],
        "recipient": [
          ["name", "Bob"],
          ["keyID", "4321DCBA"]
        ],
        "rating": 10,
        "comment": "Good"
      }</textarea>
    <pre>
);
key = util.getDefaultKey();</pre>
    <p><input type="button" value="msg.sign(key);" id="signMsg" class="btn btn-primary"></p>
    <pre id="signMsgResult"></pre>
    <p><input type="button" value="index.publishMessage(msg);" id="publishMsg" class="btn btn-primary"></p>
    <pre id="publishMsgResult"></pre>

    <p>By default, maxRating is 10 and minRating is -10.</p>

    <p>Default key is read from localStorage/filesystem or a new one is generated.</p>

    <p>If using js-ipfs, broadcast to IPFS pubsub 'identifi' channel and add to index.
    If using an ipfs proxy, post message to identi.fi which broadcasts it on the pubsub.</p>

    <p>Verification message example:</p>

    <pre>
      msg = Message.createVerification({
        author: [['name', 'Alice'], ['keyID', '1234ABCD']],
        recipient: [
          ['name', 'Bob'],
          ['keyID', '4321DCBA'],
          ['email', 'bob@example.com'],
          ['bitcoin_address', '1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa']
        ],
        comment 'Verified in person'
      });
    </pre>

    <h2>Index.create()</h2>
    <p>To be implemented.</p>

    <p>Indexes are <a href="https://github.com/mmalmi/merkle-btree">merkle-btrees</a>
    that anyone can easily write messages to, essentially creating a fork of the original
    index. Since it's a btree, you only need to rewrite one branch, not the whole tree.</p>

    <p>As of April 2018, the JS-IPFS team <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/209#issuecomment-382593283">
    is working on</a> adding IPNS support, which is needed
    for browser users of identifi to maintain permanent IPNS pointers to their indexes,
    whose IPFS hash changes on every write. Currently, only
    <a href="https://github.com/identifi/identifi-daemon">identifi-daemon</a> which
    connects to <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs">go-ipfs</a> can maintain
    the index at a permanent address.</p>

    <h2>So, what about saving the world?</h2>
    <p>Identifi's web-of-trust approach to identity management could be more resilient,
    accessible and intuitive than the hierarchical approach of DNS. It could free our
    digital identities from domain names, email providers, social media companies and phone carriers.
    Instead, we can use public key hashes as unique identifiers. Identifi solves the
    problem of connecting human-readable names (and faces) to public keys without
    a single source of truth.
    </p>

    <p>Ubiquitously available identity and reputation data would bring us closer to our
    native social habitat - a tribe or a village society where everyone knows each other.
    That would incentivize people to treat each other well and apologize and compensate
    for misdeeds. It would be a cost-effective and non-violent alternative to the punitive,
    expensive, slow and too often corrupt or unjust state monopolies of justice. See
    <a href="https://medium.com/@mmalmi/learning-to-trust-strangers-167b652a654f">
    Learning to Trust Strangers</a> and
    <a href="https://medium.com/liberation-day/law-is-better-without-monopoly-778963880276">
    Law Is Better Without Monopoly</a>.</p>

    <p>We must not let centrally managed systems like China's dystopian big brother
    "reputation" system define how we regard each other. Identifi's reputation scores always
    depend on whose web-of-trust you are looking through (and you can easily maintain your own).</p>

    <p>Identifi's web of trust can be used in other system to filter out spam,
    fake users, propaganda or other untrusted content. That is helpful when building
    decentralized social media applications, which need some way to limit write access.</p>

    <p>Storing all data on the IPFS network makes it more difficult to be shut down
    by lawsuits or oppressive governments.</p>

    <h3>In the future</h3>
    Self-driving cars, drones and other autonomous agents inhabiting the same physical space
    will need to identify each other and be accountable for their behavior. Unidentifiable
    agents, much like masked people or cars without license plates, will probably be seen
    as a threat by others and can be stopped without recourse. To avoid centralization of power,
    we should pursue a decentralized web of trust registry rather than a top-down system.

    <h2>How to solve the chicken-and-egg problem?</h2>
    <p><b>The signer and author of an Identifi message need not be the same person.</b>
    A signature on an identifi message means just that the signer verifies its authenticity.</p>
    <p>That allows us to write crawlers that import content into Identifi from other platforms.
    That makes Identifi useful even with no initial users. In the beginning, people
    can rely on 3rd parties to sign and import their messages into Identifi.</p>
    <p>The dataset you see as of April 2018 is crawled from bitcoin-otc.com.</p>

    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>If you like the idea, you can help by integrating and improving identifi-lib
    (<a href="https://github.com/identifi/identifi-lib">Github</a>) or writing crawlers.</p>

    <p>Possible applications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact details search in any application</li>
      <li>Finding payment addresses in crypto wallets</li>
      <li>Finding public keys of other users in encrypted instant messaging apps</li>
      <li>Finding network addresses of servers (instead of using DNS)</li>
      <li>Filter out untrusted content in decentralized social media</li>
      <li>Browser plugin to filter the content in existing social media</li>
      <li>Email spam filtering</li>
      <li>Filter reviews on marketplace platforms (Airbnb, eBay, Uber, LocalBitcoins)</li>
      <li>Uncensorable platforms for dispute announcement and resolution</li>
    </ul>
